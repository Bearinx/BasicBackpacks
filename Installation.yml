#The installation is literally just drag and drop, so if you are used to installing plugins, you shouldn't have to read this next part.?#

#Locate your "plugins" folder which is located in your servers home folder.#?
#Drop the downloaded Backpacks.jar into the plugins folder.?#
#Run the server once to complete the installation!?#
#NOTE: Backpacks will create some files. Do NOT delete or modify these files unless you know what you are doing. You could mess up someones backpack.?#
## Thank you for using BasicBackpacks V0.4 ##
